So, I didn't actually realise that Markdown was a *thing*.
Or rather, I thought that markdown (no capital letter) was a thing, but only recently found out that it's totally a proper noun. 

It's nice to have something which allows me to write fluidly, with formatting, but doesn't slow me down. Any punctuation can be added as **part** of the writing process, and not something that mentally feels like switching between writing and editing.  

This is something that happens all the time when writing with Microsoft Word for example.
