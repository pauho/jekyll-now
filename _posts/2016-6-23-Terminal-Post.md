title: Terminal Post
---


So, my first few posts are kind of on a continuum going from ultra-experimental test posts and will eventually culminate in fully fledged blog posts. We will just have to see how long that takes exactly. 
This posts experimentation is that I'm trying to write and post it **exclusively** from the Terminal. It's not going *spectacularly* well, as I keep on forgetting Markdown "syntax". Also, my spelling has been better and GNU Nano doesn't seem to have a spellchecker. 

Anyway, what else? I've been looking at all sorts of Terminal goodness, such as pressing CTRL + ALT + F1 to switch seamlessly into the Terminal from the GUI. The GUI is still in the background, hogging away at system resources, but it's a nice way to dip a wee toe into the black pit of Terminal computing.  One of the other Terminal goodies I tried was [Rainbowstream](http://www.rainbowstream.org), a rather spiffing Terminal twitter client which works reasonably well. Though not on this ickle, Luna eOS running netbook which I think is missing some necessary packages. 

I've also been following Bryan Lunduke's efforts to live a Terminal only existance for a month. Looks challenging, but also kinda fun.

Something that isn't fun is the EU Referendum (#EURef), which took place today. The counts are happening as I type.

Anyway, think that's nearly enough to be getting on with. Might need a better Terminal text editor, something that will at least catch any spelling errors that I will inevitably make.
