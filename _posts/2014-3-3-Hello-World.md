title: My first blog post using Jekyll
---


After a few hiccups, I think I've managed to get this to work.

Thankfully, Jekyll now has made the whole process a breeze. Only problems I had were:

1. An exiting index.html which I'd geekily setup on the command line alone.
2. Learning the exact workflow of using git to add, commit and then push. Not sure I completely comprehend what's involved at each stage but at least I know the steps.
3. Slight Github Pages build problems where some spacing issues in the _confing.yml file meant that a page was getting stuck at a particular line in the build process. Luckily, the colour features in Scratch made it easy to fix.

Anyway, only used the lists feature in Markdown. We'll see if this works.
